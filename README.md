System for Root Motion Movement in Unity

The classic problem of "how do you sync the walk cycle speed with the actual translation speed of the character so they don't moonwalk" is common for beginners and intermediate users. Often it requires a lot of manual tweaking and messy code, and usually still ends up with the characters looking like they're moonwalking.

The system here allows you to make use of root motion to minimize moonwalking in any movement scenario, in particular for Nav Mesh Agents.
